# hpc-apptainer-images
Apptainer/Singularity image definitions for use on UoS HPC systems.

Image definitions are organised according to easybuild/Lmod categorissation, e.g., the definition for an ANSYS 2025R1 container lives in `ANSYS/2025R1/ANSYS2025R1.def`.
Any related files, such as an easyconfig or module lua should be located alongside the container definition.
